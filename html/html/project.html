        <h2>Credit Card Approval Prediction :</h2>
        <pre>
             Not everyone can obtain a credit card with ease. The bank decides whether or not to issue a credit card based on
             multiple factors that demonstrate how trustworthy the person is. And credit scores objectively quantify this 
             trust factor and the amount of risk. So this project aims to create an ML model that can find out if an applicant 
             is a good or bad client for obtaining a credit card. The dataset for this contains data such as annual income,
             income category, education level, way of living, etc. to decide whether the applicant is suitable for obtaining a
             credit card or not.

        <h2>IMDB Box Office Prediction :</h2>
   <pre>        Movies are a big part of our world! But nobody knows how a movie will perform at the box office. There are some 
        big-budget movies that bomb and there are smaller movies that are smashing successes. This project tries to predict
        the overall worldwide box office revenue of movies using data such as the movie cast, crew, posters, plot keywords,
        budget, production companies, release dates, languages, and countries. The dataset on Kaggle contains all these 
        data points that you can use to predict how a movie will fare at the box office</pre>
